# PotBoard
It is a keyboard with potentiometer, it works with 2 pot. The first pot for letters, the 2nd pot for digits and symbols.

There are 2 buttons. The first button enters the selected chracter on `one` click. It comes back on `double click` and it erases eveything on `long click`.

The second button for upper case or lower case. If "bled" variable equals to 1, it is uppercase but if it is 0, it is lowercase.

It is simple to use, just turn the potentiometer.

If you want to leave space. Just make pot fully turned and click enter button.

#### The potentiometer,
Has 24 values:
- 0-22 are letters
- 23 is for activating the digits and symbols, you can only use second pot when the first pot is 23!
- 24 is space
